# Road to lockdrop

Archived: No
Date: Mar 12, 2019

The road to lockdrop contains a braindump of things we need to have done to get us to launch. It is most likely non-exhaustive

## Testing

- [ ]  We need to run through mock lockdrops
- [ ]  Test that lockdrop scripts output correct allocations
- [ ]  Launch lockdrop parameters
- [ ]  Launch on Mainnet before "lockdrop"
- [ ]  Decide on what fraction of validators we want to select from lockdrop
- [ ]  Identity Daemon Tasks
- [ ]  Pentesting scripts for everything
    - Transacting
    - Staking/bonding, etc

## Parameters

- [ ]  Number of validators

## Edgeware

- [ ]  Technical documentation on module usage (WIP from Parity) → put that into Gitbooks
- [ ]  Understanding of bugs and how to resolve them, assurance the chain is ready.
- [ ]  Audits on our modules
- [ ]  Try to run a contract (Jake or Drew)
- [ ]  Use Parity contract parameters
- [ ]  DoS / Penetration testing the network → (and communicate with Parity they have)
    - [ ]  Transaction throughput
- [ ]  Setting up a validator community → try to break it
    - [ ]  How distributed can we be across the globe? before network breaks?
        - [ ]  Nodes in China, US, Europe, and other
